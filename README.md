# ShowCompanionRequirements
In the vanilla game, if you want to send a companion to solve an issue given by a notable, you have to talk to the notable to find out the requirements, potentially wasting many mouse clicks if none of your companions meet the requirements.

This mod saves the trouble of going through that by displaying the requirements such as the duration, number of troops and their minimum tier, and the companion's skills in the notable's tooltip.

If the requirements are met, the text will be green. Else, the text will be red.

Also, if any companions meet the requirements, their names will be displayed in the tooltip.

This mod requires Harmony.

It is safe to install and uninstall on an existing save.
